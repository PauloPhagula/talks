#+TITLE: Getting Started with Cloud Computing with AWS - Abstract


When first starting, AWS can seem overwhelming. A cloud-native paradigm of
building infrastructure can be a radical departure from the traditional
on-premises way of doing things. And regardless if this is your first time
working with infrastructure or you've been tuning Linux kernels for the last
decade, it can be hard to know where to start with AWS's selection of over 175
services.

This talk is designed to help you get started with AWS regardless of your
experience. We will talk about the five pillars of AWS, mental models to use
when thinking about the cloud, and key concepts that will be applicable across
any service you end up using.

In this seminar, Arman Hezarkhani answers these three questions for students:
What is Cloud? What is GCP? And, how can you get started?
